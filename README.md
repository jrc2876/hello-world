# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, I just made my first GitHub, created a repository, and created a new branch. I am now editing the readme.md file in the new branch.
A few things about myself:
 - I am new to coding.
 - I have worked with and learned basic SQL.
 - I am learning Python.
 - I am currently obtaining a BA degree in Information Systems from VCU
 - I hope to be earning a little more than entry level salary after I graduate since I have several years of work experience
   and will begin storing my projects here to add to my resume.
